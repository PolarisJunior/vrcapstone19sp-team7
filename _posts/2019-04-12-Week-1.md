title: Week 1
---

This was our brainstorming week so most of our time was spent coming up with ideas and figuring out our project.

## What Everyone Did
This week, we engaged in lengthly brainstorming sessions to decide on a project idea that would let us explore the richness of VR capabilities in novel ways. After setting up a website and several collaborative tools, including a Slack channel and git branch for our webpage, we put together a polished project proposal included here (NOTE PUT PROJECT PROPOSAL HERE/IN POST SOMEWHERE)  

## Code Update
Team members individually worked on and looked at Unity/Steam tutorials to prepare for future project work. No project coding has been done as of yet.

## Idea Update
We decided on creating an interactive puzzle game that leverages the unique space of VR to engage and entertain users while also promoting critical and creative thinking.

## Plan for Next Week
Flesh out details on the mechanics, structure, and other features of the puzzles and overall game.

## Blocking Issues
Working out the finer elements of what our puzzles will look like and how to implement them will be an interesting challenge this coming week.
