title: Week 8

## What Everyone Did
* A.J: Debugged removing SteamVR from the Oculus version of the project, since it kept regenerating itself, and began fully transferring the project over to work on the Quest. Added a few assets for better game guidance, like animated arrows.

* P.J: 

* Ben: 

* Hannah:

## Idea Update
* We replaced the puzzle based on a throwing mechanic (too troublesome and was not generalizing well for a variety of users) with a melody puzzle

## Plan for Next Week

## Blocking Issues
* 
* Building our project into a compact, smooth executable has raised more errors than we anticipated
