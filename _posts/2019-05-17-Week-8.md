title: Week 8

## What Everyone Did
* A.J: Debugged removing SteamVR from the Oculus version of the project, since it kept regenerating itself, and began fully transferring the project over to work on the Quest. Added a few assets for better game guidance, like animated arrows.

* P.J: 

* Ben: 

* Hannah:

## Idea Update
* We removed the puzzle based on a throwing mechanic (too troublesome and was not generalizing well for a variety of users) and added a bass puzzle based on catching spheres
* Our official name is Cosmic Symphony!

## Plan for Next Week

* Have the main theme song synced to the puzzles 
* Smooth out mechanics of puzzles and add more guidance/prompts to reduce confusion

Here is what everyone will do:

P.J:

* 

Ben:
* 
*

A.J:
* Continue transferring project over to Oculus Quest (change scripts, safety check to ensure gameplay is close to identical).
* Have a working copy on the Quest headset by the end of this week.

Hannah:

## Blocking Issues
* Debugging compiled scene errors as we combine all the game elements together is nontrivial, to say the least
* Building our project into a compact, smooth executable has raised more errors than we anticipated
