## What Everyone Did
* A.J:
* P.J:
* Ben: 
* Hannah: Implemented a teleportation mechanism that allows the player to zoom to different puzzle areas. 
Once the player arrives at the destination, the camera will rotate so that the player is always facing in towards the orchestra.

## Idea Update

## Plan for Next Week
For next week, we are hoping to have a working demo with the following features
* Can teleport around the hall scene to different locations
* At the percussion location, a polished and playable version of the percussion puzzle will appear
* At the melody location, a playable (maybe not polished) version of the melody puzzle will show up
* Audio continues looping in the scene when puzzle is complete

In order to acomplish this, we have split up into 2 sub-teams. Each team will be in charge of the following.

Ben and P.J.:
* Finish and polish the percussion puzzle (adding color/animation, adding all of the instruments)
* Figure out how to load the percussion puzzle into the scene once the player arrives at the percussion location 
* If time allows, work on making the telelport experience better

Hannah and A.J.:
* Make the melody puzzle (plan what it will look like, implement the interactions, coordinate with audio)
