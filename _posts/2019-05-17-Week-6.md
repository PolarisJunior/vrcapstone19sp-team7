title: Week 6

## What Everyone Did
* A.J: 
* P.J:
* Ben:
* Hannah: Implemented he first version of the throwing puzzle, compiled everything into a single scene and worked on the mechanics of the transitions to/from each puzzle. Also ironed out teleport mechanics.

## Code Update
This week we put a lot of effort into compiling everything together and making a smooth end-to-end experience.

## Idea Update
* Throwing puzzle is way too hard. We are thinking of making it non-sequential where you can hit any note in any order instead of the order being specified.
* We are going to see what we can do about making the music a more recognizable song. It's hard to get a looping section with a structure suitable to our puzzles, but we think that a recognizable song will help pull the focus more to the music.
* Our orchesra is now located in space! We are going for the "magical orchestra" feel

## Plan for Next Week
Now it's time for polishing everything up!
* Have a working melody puzzle
* Have all of the final music files ready and syncd to the puzzles 
* Smooth out transitions between puzzles
* Smooth out mechanics of puzzles and simplify some of the puzzles

Here is what everyone will do:

## Blocking Issues
* Getting the scene to "grid out" around the peripheial when teleporting. Aleks said he will help with this :)
* Creating a throwing mechanic that is more intuitive and less difficult
* Figuring out how to make the experience focus more on the music and not just the game aspect
