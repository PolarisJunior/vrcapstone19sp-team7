## What Everyone Did
* A.J: Explored feasibility of transferring the project over to the Oculus Quest and discussed her findings with the team. Forked the team repo and began fully implementing Quest compatibility.
* P.J: PJ worked on smooth gameflow, adding a fast-forward 'hot-key' for insurance.
* Ben: 
* Hannah: 

## Code Update
We continued to compile everything into a main scene and smooth gameplay arc, debugging all of the minor issues that arose. Hannah and Ben continued to troubleshoot the throwing game section and trialled different physics-based mechanisms.
