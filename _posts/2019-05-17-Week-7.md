title: Week 7
---

## What Everyone Did
* A.J: Explored feasibility of transferring the project over to the Oculus Quest and discussed her findings with the team. Forked the team repo and began fully implementing Quest compatibility.
* P.J: PJ worked on smooth gameflow, adding a fast-forward 'hot-key' for insurance.
* Ben: 
* Hannah: 

## Code Update
We continued to compile everything into a main scene and smooth gameplay arc, debugging all of the minor issues that arose. Hannah and Ben continued to troubleshoot the throwing game section and trialled different physics-based mechanisms.

* [Special Effects](https://github.com/UWRealityLab/vrcapstone19sp-team7/tree/master/PhantasiaConductor/Assets/Scripts/Effects)


## Idea Update
* We decided on an overall unifying song! The main theme from the film [*How to Train Your Dragon*](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2C4lFUpI_4U)

Getting good feedback:

## Plan for Next Week
Add in the final song, reduce puzzle difficulty, and keep polishing!
* Easier version of throwing section
* Easier version of percussion section
* Have the main theme song synced to the puzzles 
* Smooth out mechanics of puzzles and add some guidance/prompts to reduce confusion

Here is what everyone will do:

P.J: 
*

Ben:
* 

A.J:
* Continue transferring project over to Oculus Quest (change scripts, safety check to ensure gameplay is close to identical).  

Hannah:
*

## Blocking Issues
* Figuring out the best way to scale down the difficulty of our puzzles will be a challenge. 
* Smoothing out throwing mechanics is still troublesome.
