SpawnConditions

PObjects need a spawn condition, a destroy condition, visual component,
and many will have an interactable component

instantiate always instantiates a gameobject, but then it can return a reference
to a component of that gameobject depending on generics

objects can be disabled, enabled but not alive, or enabled and alive

objects start disabled
levelmanager enables a particular level
PObjects can become live from certain actions

consider PObjectComponent Base class
