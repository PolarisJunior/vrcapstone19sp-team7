## Summary

Our project is a game in which the player navigates a 3d space trying to tap blocks (or some other object, potentially spheres/lights/bubbles) to make them disappear.  Although this mechanic is initially simple, as the game progresses, new mechanics are revealed- for example, objects of different colors may do different things, such as requiring 2 hands to touch them, flying around in the space, resetting the level when touched, and requiring being touched for a certain amount of time.

## Project Description 

One characteristic of the game is that the puzzles should be tailored to VR, in that they utilize the fact that the player is fully mobile within a 3d space, forcing the player to think about the ways they are moving around to hit all the objects. Another characteristic of the game is that there is no explicit tutorial, players will learn the mechanics intuitively as they progress through the game through trial and error, and then haveto remember what action will cause the different objects to dissappear.

## Hardware Preferences

1. Oculus Quest. Since our game will invovle a lot of moving around (potentially quickly or in non-traditional ways), the quest is our first choice because it is wireless so there is no danger of the player getting wrapped up in the cable.
2. Vive (other VR headset)

# Week 1

April 12, 2019

## What Everyone Did
This week, we engaged in lengthly brainstorming sessions to decide on a project idea that would let us explore the richness of VR capabilities in novel ways. After setting up a website and several collaborative tools, including a Slack channel and git branch for our webpage, we put together a polished project proposal. We did all of these things collectively as a team.

## Code Update
Team members individually worked on and looked at Unity/Steam tutorials to prepare for future project work. No project coding has been done as of yet.

## Idea Update
We decided on creating an interactive puzzle game that leverages the unique space of VR to engage and entertain users while also promoting critical and creative thinking.

## Plan for Next Week
* Flesh out details on the mechanics, structure, and other features of the puzzles and overall game
* Create a roadmap of milestones we want to accomplish
* Begin coding

## Blocking Issues
Working out the finer elements of what our puzzles will look like and how to implement them will be an interesting challenge this coming week.
