        "excerpt": "What Everyone Did\nThis week, as a collective team we further developed our idea for creating a Psychedlelic Symphony experience in VR by creating a rough outline of gameplay, setting, possible interactions, and possible visual designs.\nWe gathered these ideas into a narrative and explanation for Tuesday’s pitch to the class, accompanied by a colorful slide deck proposing our awesome project.\nOn Thursday, we all contributed to writing up our PRD, established milestones for the rest of the quarter, and set up initial individual roles within the team to address different project aspects. All of this was listed in the PRD, along with the specific assets we already picked out. \nAJ found a simple, yet elegant concert hall as the setting for our game, while Hannah and Ben explored additional assets and discussed game mechanics.\n\nCode Update\nTeam members continued to individually work on and looked at Unity/Steam tutorials to prepare for future project work. \nPJ set up the basic overall repo for the project and began work on the first puzzle implementation.\n\nIdea Update\nAt the end of last week, we decided on creating an interactive, rich symphony experience, similar to Fantasia 2000, but with minigame puzzles to explore rhythms and melodies in the various orchestral sections of a song.\nThe project is currently titled “Psychedelic Symphony”\n\nPlan for Next Week\n\n  Flesh out details on the mechanics, structure, and other features of the puzzles\n  Select a song and start working on syncing audio snippets to objects/motions\n  Begin coding the first puzzle for the rhythm section\n  Set up basic environment and layout with boxes to mark objects to interact with\n  Pick out initial basic assets and explore the physics effects on shapes\n\n\nBlocking Issues\nDetermining the right song and brainstorming puzzles to work in the context of the melody and rhythm will require much creativity.\nIt is currently unknown how difficult it will be to coordinate the audio, motions/interactions, and visuals at the minimal/most basic level, but it could require quite a bit of debugging and coding directed at precision of timing.\n\n",
